# data-structure-and-algorithms
solutions to practice problems and implementations of data structure and algorithms. It compiles many courses available online. Including [Coursera's Algorithms (Part I and II)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) which mainly is [Princeton's COS226](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall17/cos226/syllabus.php). I have included some other contents from outside of the course as well.
